**Description**

Do you enjoy working with different programming languages in the same project? Well, we’ve got you covered! With Fleet, you can start coding in the language of your choice. Fleet is designed to automatically detect your project configuration from the source code, maximizing the value you get from its smart code-processing engine while minimizing the need for project configuration.

**Notes**

`ENABLE_STARTUP_SCRIPTS` when set to `yes` will allow a user to install additional packages from the official Arch Repository or the Arch User Repository (AUR) via scripts located in the folder `/config/home/scripts/`. A sample script is located at `/config/home/scripts/example-startup-script.sh` with comments to guide the user on script creation.

User ID (PUID) and Group ID (PGID) can be found by issuing the following command for the user you want to run the container as:-

```

```
